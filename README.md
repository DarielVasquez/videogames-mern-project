# Favorite Video Games List - MERN Stack App

This is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that allows users to save a list of their favorite video games.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Usage

Upon opening the application, users can create an account or log in with an existing account. Once logged in, users can add games to their favorites list by clicking the "Add to Favorites" button. Users can also delete games from their favorites list by clicking the "Delete" button next to a game.
